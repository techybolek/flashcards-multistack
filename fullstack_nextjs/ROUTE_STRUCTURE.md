# Next.js Application Route Structure and Flow

## Route Structure (Inferred)

- `/`  
  Main entry point, handled by `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `/generations/:id`  
  Feature page, with dynamic subroutes such as `/generations/[id]` for individual generation details.
- `/generate`  
  Possibly a page for creating or generating new resources.
- `/auth`  
  Authentication-related pages (e.g., login, register, recover).
- `/dashboard`  
  User dashboard or main authenticated area.
- `/api`  
  API routes, including `/api/auth` for authentication endpoints (login, logout, register, recover, user info).

## General Flow (Inferred)

1. **Authentication**:  
   Users interact with `/auth` pages to log in, register, or recover accounts.  
   API routes under `/api/auth` handle backend authentication logic.

2. **Main Application**:  
   After authentication, users are likely redirected to `/dashboard` or the main `/` page.  
   Users can view or manage "generations" via `/generations/[id]`.  
   Users can create new items or resources via `/generate`.

3. **API**:  
   The `/api` directory provides backend endpoints for authentication and possibly other features.
